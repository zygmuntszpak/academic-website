abstract = "The topic of machine learning can be a daunting one and many businesses fear that engaging with their data in more depth will be expensive and time consuming, with intangible outcomes. However, what is often neglected is the strategic danger of NOT engaging on a deeper level with your data. This workshop will deliver material at a high level, targeted at key decision makers within SMEs and with minimal technical detail, to facilitate an understanding of the impact Machine Learning can have on your business.Through a series of case studies that consider previous collaborations between SMEs and the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, the workshop aims to demonstrate that not all problems require a significant research project, or well-structured data, to reveal insightful correlations which can facilitate improved productivity and/or profitability for small business."
